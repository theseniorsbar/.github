**IT bar with soul and talks every day**

## 👋 About Us

**Senior's** is not just a bar. It's a place where developers, designers, product managers, and curious minds gather to discuss technology, listen to talks, and enjoy great cocktails.

Every evening something interesting happens here: meetups, workshops, discussions about Web3, AI, startups, and IT careers. We believe the best ideas are born at the bar counter, not in meeting rooms.
